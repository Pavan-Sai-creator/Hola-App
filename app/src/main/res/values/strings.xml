    <string name="developer_info">Pavan Sai.K is a student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, pursuing Computer Science Engineering with specialization in Cloud Computing. Being stuck at home due to the Pandemic was a wonderful opportunity for him, to explore various things related to Computer Science. While playing with mobile phones, his curiosity to know how android applications without which lives of people would be unimaginable, are made, ignited his interest in learning Android App Development. </string>
    <string name="naveen_info">Naveen Atla is one of Pavan\'s classmates and best friend. He thought that lockdown was the best time to be productive and learn something new that would boost his career. Both being on the same boat, joined their hands and took their first step towards their goal. Without any further delay, they started watching tutorials on YouTube, referred many online websites and learnt basics of App Development. Theoretical knowledge wasn\'t their style. They wanted project based learning. That is when they thought of making an app which involves all the concepts they have learnt so far. This led to the birth of HOLA..!</string>
